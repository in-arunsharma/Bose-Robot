## 🎯 What We Did Today
- Initial meeting to explain the robot project.
- Ideation session to generate possible features and objectives.
- We agreed on the main concept: A robot capable of traversing different terrains and creating a 3D map of the area.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic               | Decision                                   | Why                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Main objective            | Robot with versatile mobility and 3D mapping	    | Meets the project requirements for exploration and map generation              |
| Types of terrain to cover	   | Flat ground, sand, and rocky terrain	   | Allows testing of suspension and traction systems under different conditions         |
| Mapping tools	| LiDAR sensor + RGB-D camera	| Combines high-precision distance data (LiDAR) with color/texture data (RGB-D) |


## 🧪 What We Tested
- Brainstormed chassis ideas and wheel types.
- Mentally simulated the data flow from sensor to SLAM algorithm.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- A wide range of initial ideas led to some difficulty prioritizing features.
- Uncertainty about the best way to integrate the LiDAR sensor with our chosen platform.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Define technical requirements for suspension and wheels.
- Select a specific LiDAR module (range, accuracy, interface).
- Prepare a rough mechanical design sketch in CAD.
