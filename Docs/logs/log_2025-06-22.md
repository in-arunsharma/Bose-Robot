## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Covered the small flat-surface wheels with the same rubber as the main wheels to improve traction
* Mounted the camera and ultrasonic sensor onto the new front structure
* Closed the transparent box with all components inside
* Confirmed that the full circuitry remains correctly connected and functional

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic                | Decision                                      | Why                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Wheel traction       | Added rubber to small wheels                  | To ensure grip on flat surfaces                   |
| Sensor mounting      | Fixed camera and ultrasound on new structure  | Final positioning for perception components       |
| Enclosure            | Closed transparent box                        | All elements now protected and enclosed properly  |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Structural fit of new components
* Final electrical connections
* Grip of small wheels with new rubber layer

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Robot is heavier than expected, which could affect mobility and climbing

## 📌 Next Steps

* Test robot movement with full weight
* Evaluate need for mechanical or motor adjustments due to increased weight
