## 🎯 What We Did Today
- Printed a new 3D camera stand with reduced height, since the previous version was too tall.
- Printed what is likely the final version of the lifters.
- Printed new motor cases, but they turned out too narrow due to lack of datasheet measurements.
- Attempted to expand motor cases using heat in the oven, but results were uneven — will reprint.
- Printed servo stabilizers to prevent unwanted movement.
- Printed two small wheels to allow the robot to move on flat surfaces.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic               | Decision                                   | Why                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Camera stand height | Lowered the camera mount                   | Previous version placed the camera too high          |
| Motor case design   | Reprint with corrected measurements         | Current version is too narrow and deformed after heating |
| Servo stabilization | Added printed brackets                     | Prevents servos from shifting during movement        |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Fit and alignment of the new camera stand.
- Fit of the motor cases (unsuccessful).
- Stability improvements from the servo brackets.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- Lack of motor datasheet caused inaccurate case sizing.
- Heat-expansion workaround for motor cases didn’t work well — parts warped and became asymmetric.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Reprint the motor cases with updated dimensions based on manual measurements.
- Begin mounting and aligning all components for first full movement test.
- Evaluate performance of small wheels on flat surfaces.
