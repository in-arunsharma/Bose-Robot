## 🎯 What We Did Today
1. Began assembling and testing individual robot components.  
2. Created the initial **software architecture diagram** to define system modules and data flow.  
3. Designed the first draft of the **mechanical structure** and chassis.

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic                 | Decision                                                                                     | Why                                                                              |

| Main navigation       | Use a basic visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm for positioning    | Allows the robot to understand its exact location while moving up/down stairs    |
| Mechanical layout     | Designed a compact base to hold electronics, battery, and motors                            | Ensures balanced weight distribution and compactness for stair maneuverability    |
| Software architecture | Divided software into modules: Sensor Data, SLAM, Motor Control, Obstacle Detection, UI      | Modular design makes the system easier to debug, develop, and scale               |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Checked the physical fit of Raspberry Pi, motor driver, LiPo battery, and sensors on the chassis.  
- Sketched and reviewed the software module interactions, including camera input feeding into SLAM.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- Space constraints when placing all components on the compact chassis.  
- Ensuring stable power delivery from the LiPo battery to both motors and Raspberry Pi without voltage drops.

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Finalize and 3D-print the mechanical frame to fit all components securely.  
2. Start implementing the software modules based on the diagram (beginning with motor control and sensor reading).  
3. Set up a basic SLAM pipeline using camera input and test initial localization indoors.  
4. Test power system under full load to ensure no brownouts on the Raspberry Pi.
