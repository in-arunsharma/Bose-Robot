## üéØ What We Did Today
- Revisited our initial concept and brainstormed alternative locomotion methods.
- Decided to pivot to a stair-climbing design using two helical (spiral) wheels mounted on a stable base.
- Selected and confirmed the key hardware components for this new configuration.

## üß™ What We Tested
- Reviewed mechanical feasibility of mounting helical wheels on the existing chassis.  
- Verified compatibility of DRV8833 driver with Micro Metal LP motors in simulation.

## üîß Problems Faced
- Ensuring sufficient ground clearance for the helical wheels during flat-terrain traversal.  
- Balancing weight distribution to prevent front or rear tipping when climbing stairs.  

## üìå Next Steps
1. Design and 3D-print a mounting bracket for the helical wheels and motor assemblies.  
2. Prototype the base frame in CAD, incorporating battery and electronics compartments.  
3. Write and test low-level motor control routines for synchronized helical-wheel rotation.  
4. Plan initial physical trials on a demo stair module (3‚Äì5 steps).
