## 🎯 What We Did Today
- Laser cutting of the initial prototype of the tri-helix wheel on a single wood sheet.  
- Printed a one-layer wheel prototype to validate dimensions.  
- Tested the single-layer prototype on actual stairs to assess the fit and traction of only one layer of wood.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic                  | Decision                                         | Why                                                                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manufacturing method   | Use laser-cut wood lamina instead of 3D printing | Wheel diameter is quite large, so the laser cutting on sheet stock is faster, less expensive for out universoty, and reduces material waste |
| Future wheel design    | Laminate multiple wood sheets by gluing together | Could produce a lighter and stronger structure. |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Staircase traversal performance with the single-layer prototype.  
- Dimensional accuracy of laser-cut lamina compared to CAD model.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- We ran into some issues when exporting the 3D model of the wheel — the format wasn’t compatible with the laser cutter software, so we had to re-export and adjust several times.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Start working on the design of the **final wheel model** now that the dimensions are validated.  
- Create updated file for the **layered version of the tri-helix wheel**, splitting it into multiple parts for easier assembly.  
- Design and include the **three alignment triangles** that will help the wheel match the stair edges correctly.
