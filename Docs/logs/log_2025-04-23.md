## 🎯 What We Did Today
1. Fully assembled the robot, including all hardware components.  
2. Installed and mounted all 3D-printed parts designed for the chassis and wheel system.  
3. Integrated all key components: motors, motor drivers, Raspberry Pi, battery, sensors, and camera.

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Final assembly   | Assembled full robot with printed parts and installed all components   | Ensured everything fits together physically and all connections are ready for testing |
| Focus area       | Prioritize testing motor power and torque for stair climbing           | Initial tests showed the motors struggle to lift the robot, which could block progress |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Verified mechanical integrity of the complete build.  
- Performed first motion tests to assess the robot’s ability to move on flat ground and attempt stair climbing.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- Major issue identified: motors lack sufficient torque to easily move the robot or climb stairs.  
- Some structural flexing under the robot’s weight, especially when under motor load.

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Analyze torque requirements and calculate if higher-torque motors or gear ratio adjustments are needed.  
2. Consider reducing the robot’s weight by optimizing 3D-printed parts or layout.  
3. Test alternative wheel configurations or assistive mechanisms to improve stair climbing.  
4. Reassess power system to ensure motors receive maximum available current without losses.
