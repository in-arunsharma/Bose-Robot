## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Mounted the robot hardware for the first time
* Conducted a simple test using an ultrasonic sensor to explore software-hardware integration
* Received most of the ordered components
* Selected motors based on physical resistance (couldn’t move shaft by hand)

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic        | Decision                               | Why                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Motor choice | Chose the motor with immovable shaft   | Assumed it had high gear ratio and torque |
| Power supply | Used 8×1.2V NiMH cells instead of LiPo | Ordered LiPo battery didn’t arrive        |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Integration of ultrasonic sensor with software
* Motor torque evaluation (manually, by feel)

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Some components (e.g., LiPo battery) didn’t arrive
* Gear ratio of motors was unknown at the time (later estimated \~150:1)

## 📌 Next Steps

* Proceed with system integration using received components
* Replace temporary power supply with proper LiPo when available
* Begin planning for mobility and torque testing in upcoming sessions
