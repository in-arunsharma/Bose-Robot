## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Documented on paper the current wheel configuration
* Tested remote control of the main wheels
* Observed erratic behavior in the large wheel motors — responses were nearly random when commands were sent
* Identified a potential issue with the I²C communication causing this behavior
* Noticed that the servos malfunctioned even when idle, likely due to software-related problems

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic                | Decision                                      | Why                                                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Wheel control        | Investigate I²C issues                        | Motors behave unpredictably when receiving commands    |
| Servo behavior       | Suspect software-related malfunction          | Servos misbehave without active input                  |
| Documentation        | Paper-based layout of wheel configuration     | Clarifies current physical and logical setup           |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Remote control of main wheels via software
* Passive behavior of servos with no active commands
* Wheel configuration review

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Unstable motor control likely caused by I²C errors
* Servos misbehaving even when not commanded — suspected software bug

## 📌 Next Steps

* Debug I²C communication and motor driver integration
* Test servo behavior in isolation
* Migrating configuration notes to digital format for report
