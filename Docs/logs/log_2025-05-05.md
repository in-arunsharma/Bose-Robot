## 🎯 What We Did Today
- 3D printed:  
  - A new and improved camera stand with increased height and better stability  
  - The bottom part of the battery case  
  - These parts ended up being **double-colored** due to a filament runout mid-print, but they are still functional  
- Laser cut the **wooden base of the robot**, including an engraved dedication recognizing all team members, our teachers, and the support of the Open Labs.  
- Planned to cut the tail section of the robot, but couldn’t proceed due to **time constraints** and issues with the lab computer.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic              | Decision                                     | Why                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Camera support     | Reprint with taller, more stable design      | The original was too short and unstable for the actual camera usage |
| Robot base         | Engrave credits on wooden base               | A meaningful touch to highlight collaboration and contributors      |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Fit and balance of the new camera stand  
- Stability of the wooden base with the current component layout

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- The filament ran out mid-print, resulting in a color change on the printed parts  
- Couldn’t cut the robot’s tail due to limited lab time and a malfunctioning lab computer

## 📌 Next Steps
- Reschedule the laser cutting of the robot’s tail piece  
- Assemble all printed and laser-cut parts together on the robot base  
- Test overall structural stability and the new base and camera stand
