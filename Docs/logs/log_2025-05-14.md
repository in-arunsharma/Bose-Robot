## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Assembled the first physical version of the robot (MVP)
* Tested initial motors — found them too weak due to low torque
* Rejected a 12V motor offered by the lab (no gear ratio)
* Planned to test new motors before next session

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic               | Decision                                     | Why                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Motor selection     | Rejected 12V motor with no gearbox           | No gear ratio = insufficient torque                  |
| Gear ratio strategy | Use Maxon motors with 157:1 gear ratio (12V) | Higher torque, possibly suitable for climbing stairs |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Original MVP with basic motors
* 12V motors with 30:1 gear ratio (failed test)
* Received Maxon 12V motors with 157:1 gear ratio (not yet tested)

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Initial motors lacked the necessary torque
* 30:1 gear ratio motors were also too weak
* No suitable motor options from lab stock until teacher’s help

## 📌 Next Steps

* Test Maxon motors (157:1) provided by the teacher
* Evaluate climbing performance with new motors
* Integrate the 14V battery into the system
* Prepare for potential final integration in the following session
