## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Tested the remote control program for the robot
* Replaced existing gears with larger ones to increase torque
* Re-soldered some circuit elements that had come loose
* Laser-cut support pieces for the robot’s tail

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic                 | Decision                                 | Why                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Gear change           | Switched to larger gears                 | To increase torque and improve movement strength |
| Circuit maintenance   | Re-soldered loose connections            | Ensure reliable operation and avoid signal loss  |
| Tail stability        | Printed support pieces for tail          | To keep the robot balanced during movement       |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Remote control response
* Performance with new gear ratio
* Electrical continuity after re-soldering

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Laser cutter had to be stopped temporarily due to smoke extractor failure

## 📌 Next Steps

* Retest full system with improved gearing
* Mount tail support pieces and validate mechanical stability
* Continue refining remote control software
