## 🎯 What We Did Today
1. Reviewed the current motor-to-wheel setup and identified structural limitations.  
2. Decided to add **gears** between the motors and the wheels to increase the torque and improve stair-climbing performance.  
3. Considered the possibility of using **servo motors**, but concluded they were not suitable for the torque and continuous rotation needed for stair climbing.

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic               | Decision                                               | Why                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Power transmission  | Add a gear system between motors and wheels            | Helps multiply torque and reduce the load directly on the motors                     |
| Motor type          | Stick with DC motors + gears instead of switching to servos | Servos don’t provide continuous rotation or sufficient power for stair climbing tasks |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Evaluated current torque limitations when the robot is under stair-climbing load.  
- Explored mechanical configurations for fitting a gear system onto the existing chassis.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- Space constraints on the chassis for mounting additional gears.  
- Complexity in aligning gears properly to avoid slippage or efficiency loss.

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Design and 3D-print gear mounts and adapters to fit between motors and wheels.  
2. Test the new geared system under load to confirm improved climbing performance.  
3. Rebalance the chassis layout if needed to accommodate new mechanical components.  
4. Final preparation for the presentation, ensuring both hardware and software run smoothly.
