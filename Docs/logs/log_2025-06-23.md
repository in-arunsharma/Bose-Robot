## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Discussed performance issues: the robot is heavier than expected
* Held a meeting to organize the final presentation
* Identified that the axles are not powerful enough for reliable movement
* Began formalizing the circuit diagram for documentation

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic               | Decision                              | Why                                               |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Presentation prep   | Started outlining final presentation   | To distribute tasks and define content structure  |
| Axle assessment     | Acknowledge performance limitations    | Motors/axles not strong enough for current weight |
| Circuit documentation | Begin formal circuit schematic        | Required for final report and clarity             |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Communication between components

## 📌 Next Steps

* Complete circuit formalization
* Prepare slides and visual material for final presentation
* Consider summarizing hardware limitations in conclusions
