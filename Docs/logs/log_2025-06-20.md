## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Completed soldering of the full circuit board
* Verified the integration and communication between all components

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic             | Decision                                  | Why                                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Circuit integration | Finalized full system wiring and testing | Ensures all modules communicate correctly and are ready for testing |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Power system distribution
* Communication between:
  - Motor drivers
  - Main controller
  - Sensors:
    - IMU
    - Encoders
    - 2D-LiDAR
* General circuit functionality

## 📌 Next Steps

* Begin system-level testing with software
* Monitor sensor readings
