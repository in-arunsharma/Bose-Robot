## 🎯 What We Did Today
1. Pushed all recent progress and code updates to the project’s GitHub repository.  
2. Finalized the integration of the new motors, which now successfully allow the robot to climb stairs smoothly.  
3. Verified that the robot’s hardware and software are working together as expected — we are almost ready for the final presentation!

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic            | Decision                                                  | Why                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version control  | Update and sync all project files on GitHub               | Ensure the whole team has access and version history is tracked |
| Motor system     | Final implementation of high-torque motors                | Achieves the necessary power for reliable stair climbing       |
| Project status   | Prepare for presentation                                  | With most core functions working, focus shifts to demo prep    |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Tested full robot operation, including stair-climbing performance.  
- Checked integration between motor commands and SLAM navigation.  
- Confirmed all software runs smoothly from the Raspberry Pi.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- Minor adjustments were needed to balance motor power and control for smooth stair climbing.  
- Some Git merge conflicts appeared when syncing code from different branches (resolved).

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Prepare the final project presentation, including live demo and explanation slides.  
2. Run full tests in the demo environment to ensure everything works under presentation conditions.  
3. Review and polish the codebase and documentation on GitHub for final delivery.
