## 🎯 What We Did Today

* Concluded the last compulsory lab session (Session 6)
* Tested Maxon motors; found them too weak for climbing or flat surface movement
* Tried alternative motor from the lab, but it burned out at the stalling limit
* Received a 2D-LiDAR sensor due to limitations of camera-only navigation

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Topic          | Decision                              | Why                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Motor strategy | Move focus to software if motors fail | Current motors are inadequate; need higher torque |
| Sensor suite   | Add 2D-LiDAR to setup                 | Camera-only navigation was too unreliable         |

## 🧪 What We Tested

* Maxon motors on stairs and flat surface
* Alternative lab-provided motor
* Initial integration of 2D-LiDAR

## 🔧 Problems Faced

* Maxon motors couldn't generate enough torque
* Lab motor burned out during testing
* General demotivation due to repeated hardware failures

## 📌 Next Steps

* Focus on developing simple software fallback solution
* Attend upcoming optional lab sessions to test other motor options
* If new motors allow climbing, continue with full software pipeline; otherwise, limit scope
