## 🎯 What We Did Today
- We structured the entire project repository for clarity and scalability.
- Created a clear directory layout for:
  - `hardware/` (all 3D models, laser cuts, circuit designs)
  - `software/` (motion, sensors, SLAM, utility scripts)
  - `docs/` (daily logs, decision table, final report)
  - `media/` (photos, renders, GIFs)
- Established a consistent format for daily logs and decision logs.
- Decided to document every key technical and design decision made.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic              | Decision                                                  | Why                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repository layout  | Use clean folder structure with hardware/software/docs    | Makes code, design files, and documentation easy to navigate        |
| Logs               | Daily Markdown logs + decision table                      | Helps track progress, justifies choices, supports final report      |
| License            | Use MIT License                                           | Open source, easy reuse, clear team attribution                     |
| Documentation style| Markdown + GitHub + final scientific report               | Readable, lightweight, easy to version                              |

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- We had many STL files, circuit images, and code scattered around.
- Decision justifications were in team chat only — hard to trace.
- No proper logging of progress or rationale up to this point.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Begin regular daily logs after each work session or milestone.
- Migrate and sort old files into the new folder structure.
- Push the full structured repo to GitHub with README and LICENSE.
