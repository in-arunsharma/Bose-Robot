## 🎯 What We Did Today
- 3D printed several components: brackets for the transparent box, initial prototype of the robot lifters, and servo brackets.
- Laser cut two small wooden pieces to stabilize the robot's tail, which was moving excessively during testing.

## 💡 Decisions Made
| Topic               | Decision                                   | Why                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Transparent box mounting | Redesigned brackets to be sturdier             | Original ones broke during installation             |
| Tail stability support  | Added wooden supports via laser cut             | Tail was too loose and affected balance             |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Fit and strength of the newly printed brackets.
- Effectiveness of the wooden tail supports during basic movement.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- The first set of printed brackets cracked when attaching the transparent box.
- The tail was too unstable, requiring reinforcement.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Ensure all structural elements are securely mounted for the next movement test.
