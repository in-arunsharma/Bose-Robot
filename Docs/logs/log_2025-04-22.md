## 🎯 What We Did Today
- 3D printed several small structural parts related to component stability:  
  - Battery bracket  
  - Camera handle  
  - Motor cases  
  - Raspberry Pi case  
  - Ultrasonic sensor mount  
- Laser cut **two new tri-helix wheels**, which are intended to be the final design version.

## 💡 Decisions Made

| Structural mounts  | 3D print small component holders             | Keeps elements securely in place                                    |
| Wheel design       | Laser cut final version of tri-helix wheels  | We refined the previous design by adding holes to reduce weight and compensate for the thickness added by layering multiple wooden sheets, aiming for better traction and lighter wheels |

## 🧪 What We Tested
- Fit and placement of the 3D printed structural components on the chassis.  
- Assembly of the two final laser-cut tri-helix wheels.

## 🔧 Problems Faced
- All the laser-cut parts required manual sanding to remove small imperfections and ensure proper fit during assembly.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Mount the new tri-helix wheels onto the motors and test it manually in stairs.
- Evaluate motors strenght with the new wheels.
